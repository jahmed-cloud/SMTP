How To Install Docker Compose on Linux

You need curl and wget installed on your system for this operation. And definitely, access to the Terminal as a user with sudo privileges.

### CentOS / RHEL ###
sudo yum -y install curl wget

### Debian / Ubuntu ###
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y curl wget

### Fedora ###
sudo dnf -y install curl wget

Once curl has been installed, download the latest Compose on your Linux machine.
	curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/docker/compose/releases/latest | grep browser_download_url  | grep docker-compose-linux-x86_64 | cut -d '"' -f 4 | wget -qi -
Make the binary file executable.
	chmod +x docker-compose-linux-x86_64
Move the file to your PATH.
	sudo mv docker-compose-linux-x86_64 /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
Confirm version.
	docker-compose version
Add user to docker group:
	sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
	newgrp docker

Configure Compose Command-line completion
Compose has command completion for the bash and zsh shell.
	For Bash users : Place the completion script in /etc/bash_completion.d/.
		sudo curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docker/compose/master/contrib/completion/bash/docker-compose -o /etc/bash_completion.d/docker-compose
	Source the file or re-login to enjoy completion feature.	
		source /etc/bash_completion.d/docker-compose
	For Zsh users: Download the completion script in your ~/.zsh/completion/
		mkdir -p ~/.zsh/completion
		curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docker/compose/master/contrib/completion/zsh/_docker-compose > ~/.zsh/completion/_docker-compose
Include the directory in your $fpath by adding in ~/.zshrc:
	fpath=(~/.zsh/completion $fpath)
Then reload your shell:
	exec $SHELL -l

Test Docker Compose installation.
	nano docker-compose.yml
Add below data to the file.
	version: '3'  
services:
  web:
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
     - "8080:80"
